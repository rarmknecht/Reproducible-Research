# Preparing the environment
It's good practice to set the working directory at the start of a project:
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/ranarm01/Documents/Github/Coursera-ReproduciableResearch")
```

# Loading and Processing the Data

1. Load the Data


This process requires that we first obtain the data:
```{r}
data.url <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata/data/activity.zip'
download.file(data.url, destfile="raw_activity.zip")
unzip('raw_activity.zip')
```

Now we can load the data we've downloaded:
```{r}
list.files()
data.raw <- read.csv("activity.csv")
dim(data.raw)
head(data.raw)
```
2. Process / Transform the Data
The data appears to have three clearly defined columns and meets the requirements for tidy data.  No transformation is needed at this point.

# What is the mean total number of steps taken each day?
For this question, we will ignore the missing values within the data set

```{r}
data.no_na <- data.raw[!is.na(data.raw$steps),]
data.na <- data.raw[is.na(data.raw$steps),]
```

1. Calculate the # of steps taken each day
```{r}
#?aggregate
data.steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data.no_na, sum)
```

2. Create a histogram of the steps taken each day
```{r}
#?hist
#hist(data.steps_by_day$steps)
hist(data.steps_by_day$steps, 
     breaks=20, 
     col="#4488dd", 
     main='Historgram of Steps per Day',
     xlab='Steps',
     ylab='Frequency')
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
